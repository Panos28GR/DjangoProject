# DjangoProject
Methods of changing the passwords of University users using social networks.
Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Thanks for checking it out.
This project presents the implementation of an online application for changing the passwords of users of the Facebook social page, which informs users about password changes through Messenger.

My goal is to create a standard application that will simulate DJANGO
connecting a user to a system and disconnecting from it as well as
subscribe to it.
During registration the user gives the username, password and
name of his FB page.
In case of connection problem (eg forget the password
of) then goes to a page that does the password recovery. 
To do this it is sent to
user a reset code on FB and his email and the user typing
makes him Recovery.
